# Sum of All Fears
 
 This is not the movie, but actually a JavaScript challenge.  This application accepts 5 inputs from the user.  The last input will be called the "K" value.  If any of the first four numbers can be added together to reach the value of K then those numbers will be revealed after clicking the button.
